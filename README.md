## Where are your memories?

Memory Dive aims to fill the void between ourselves and the silos of personal and public data that we all generate.

Memory Dive:

1. Gathers all the data that the *user generated* or that references them on the services that the users connect to it (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote, email etc.)
2. Indexes all the data and makes it available for browsing and search.
3. Offers statistics and other features to make the service more engaging (e.g. daily email with memories)
4. Automates backup of all user data (collected and generated on the service)

Memory Dive never:

1. Reads, analyzes, shares or similar any of the user's data for any purpose apart from actually providing the service.
2. Sell or publish *any* kind of user information, even in aggregate.

Memory Dive has user-aligned freemium model:

1. All users are welcome and free to stay.
2. We don't sell ad space.
3. We sell premium access to those users that want to get more out of the service.
